# BlackjaMOD1 Project Game - Blackjackck

## Overview
This Blackjack game is a two-person game.  The player against the computer.  Player places bets on hand.  As the player continues to play, the winnings accumulate.  Game ends when the player ends the game or runs out of money. 

## Rules of the Game
Dealer (computer) deals two cards face up to the player.  The dealer deals two cards to herself one face up and one face down.

The player has the choice to “stay” or “hit”.  The player can “hit” multiple times  until they reach or exceed 21.

The dealer plays after the player has finished.  The dealer reveals her hidden card.  The dealer must hit if her hand is less than 17.  At 17 or greater, the dealer must stay.

The winner is determined by the following rules:
> * If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), and the dealer does not, the player wins.
>* If the player exceeds a sum of 21 ("busts"); the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.
>* If the dealer exceeds 21 ("busts") and the player does not; the player wins.
>* If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust; the player wins.
>* If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, called a "push", no one wins.

The player receives 1.5 times the bet for a win and 2 times the bet for a natural blackjack (i.e. ace and facecard).  The player loses the bet if they lose.   For a push, the player keeps the bet.

The player can choose to stop the game.  The game ends if the player has no money.
